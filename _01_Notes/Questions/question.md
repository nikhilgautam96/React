# Questions :-

1. When we click on a resouce and the link takes to a new tab in a SPA,
    - in that case the entire page loads so is the html and css for that page also fetched at the beginning and just the contents are filled with an api call and the page is being displayed/rendered on a new tab.
    - or is it that a new html+css+js for that page is fetched after the click.
